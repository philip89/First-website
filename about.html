			<h2>About Us</h2>
			<p>Based just outside County Kilkenny, Flagmount quarry is re-opening for the first time in nearly 120 years. 
			Until the late nineteen hundreds Flagmount quarry was a family run business.Quarrying stone which they used for
			Building walls, Tiling floors, Pier and Wall capping and lintels for doors and windows. With the widespread introduction
			of Concrete and blocks the quarry became less and less profitable until its closure in 1902. The quarry has sat idle until
			now in 2015 it is being re opened. Our aim is to produce top quality Irish paving stone for people looking to give there new 
			or existing home the historic Irish look that was so common all them years ago.</p>
